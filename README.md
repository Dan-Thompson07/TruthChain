# ðŸ‘® Key Security Features
- **SHA-256 Hash stored on clockchain for article integrity**:
  Provides proof of authenticity without having to store the article itself

- **Immutable Storage of results on the Algernon Blockchain**:
  AI results are written to the blockchain using Algernon smart contracts, which guarantees that verification results stay permanent and trustworthy.
-  **Data Privacy Through Off-Chain Storage**:
  The full article text and AI analysis are stored off-chain, meaning that Usersâ€™ data stays private while still verifiable via the hash.


# System interaction flow

**1.** User submits article text through the frontend.

**2.** Frontend sends the content to the backend AI module.

**3.** AI model analyzes the article using a pre-trained fake news detection algorithm and generates a Reliability Score.

**4.** Backend creates a SHA-256 hash of the article content to generate a unique digital fingerprint.

**5.** Backend calls the Algernon Smart Contract to record the hash, Reliability Score, and timestamp on the blockchain.

**6.** Blockchain transaction confirms the record, ensuring immutability and public verifiability.

**7.** Frontend displays results to the user â€” including the Reliability Score and the blockchain verification hash for transparency.

# âœ… Final Summary
TruthChain secures its AI verification process using SHA-256 hashing and Algernon smart contracts, ensuring that every news articleâ€™s integrity and authenticity can be independently verified, permanently stored, and protected from tampering.

 **This architecture ensures that**:
- Every articleâ€™s fingerprint is securely hashed and immutably stored on-chain.
- Verification data remains tamper-proof and publicly auditable.
- AI models can evolve independently while maintaining historical integrity.
- Users can trust that no verified record can ever be altered or forged.
